### User Ordering Process

0. **User Access Interface and Enter Credentials:**
- The user accesses the interface and enters their credentials.

1. **Obtain JWT Token and Validate User Credentials:**
- The Frontend Service obtains the JWT token by consuming the AzureAD authentication API.
- Frontend Service invokes the User Service API to validate user credentials.
  1. User Service validates the token using the check token service of the Azure AD API.
  2. User Service queries the database (USERS table) to verify user credentials.
     <- User Service returns the user data to the Frontend Service.

2. **Retrieve Product List:**
- Frontend invokes the Product Service API to obtain the list of products.
  1. Product Service validates the token using the check token service of the Azure AD API.
  2. Product Service queries the database (PRODUCTS table) to retrieve the products.
     <- Product Service returns the data to the Frontend Service.
     <- Frontend displays the order page.
     -> User selects entry, main course, and drinks, then clicks the order button.

3. **Create a New Order:**
- Frontend Service invokes the Order Service API to create a new order.
  1. Order Service validates the token using the check token service of the Azure AD API.
  2. Order Service inserts the selected user data into the database (ORDERS and ITEMS tables).
     <- Order Service returns the created order data to the Frontend Service.
     <- Frontend displays the order summary page with selected product data and the total calories of the order.
     -> User clicks the modify order button.
     <- Frontend displays the order page, allowing the user to make changes.
     -> User selects entry, main course, and drinks, then clicks the order button.

4. **Modify an Existing Order:**
- Frontend Service invokes the Order Service API to modify the order.
  1. Order Service validates the token using the check token service of the Azure AD API.
  2. Order Service modifies the order, creating a new version of its items in the database (ORDERS and ITEMS tables).
     <- Order Service returns the order and its item data to the Frontend.
     <- Frontend displays the order summary page with selected product data and the total calories of the order.
